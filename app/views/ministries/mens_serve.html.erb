      “Then, after doing all those things, I will pour out my Spirit upon all people.
      Your sons and daughters will prophesy. Your old men will dream dreams, and
      your young men will see visions.” – Joel 2:28 NLT

      We value the life and growth that happens when men commit to investing in
      honest friendship with other men. In an effort to become men who live and love
      like Jesus, we are looking for other like-minded men to join our Men’s Ministry
      Team to reach our brothers in the name of Christ. Current areas that are open
      for others to serve in this ministry include teachers, mentors, and deacons.
      Men who serve in a teaching role are called upon to help lead instructional time
      at men’s ministry specific events. They additionally may be called upon to help
      facilitate in other teaching settings for various ministries of CRCC.

      Men who serve in a mentor role are called upon to invest in the life of another
      man in the ministry who is younger in the faith (though not always younger in
      age). These mentors are called upon to help teach and model for other men
      what it means to be a follower of Jesus.

      Men who serve in the role of a Deacon are called upon to facilitate the work of

      supporting the work of the other ministries of the church such as Children’s and
      Youth activities; learning the roles and responsibilities of being an elder at
