      <b>What We Value:</b>
      <br>
      We desire for women to grow deeper in their relationship with Christ and one
      another in an environment that is safe, encouraging and accepting. We believe
      it is important for women to develop trusted friendships with other women to
      more fully experience the support, love and accountability that blossoms from
      this kind of fellowship.
