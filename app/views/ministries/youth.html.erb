      “Don’t let anyone think less of you because you are young. Be an example to all
      believers in what you say, in the way you live, in your love, your faith, and
      your purity.” -2 Timothy 4:12 (NLT)

      <b>What We Value</b>
      <br>
      We desire to train our youth to be strong leaders and Godly examples of
      Christ amongst their peers. We purposefully disciple our youth in intentional
      and practical ways to further develop their personal relationship with Jesus
      and to share their faith in their community. We design our youth 	meetings to
      be a safe, welcoming and challenging environment where 	friendships and mentoring
      can easily take place in order for our youth to flourish interpersonally and
      spiritually.
