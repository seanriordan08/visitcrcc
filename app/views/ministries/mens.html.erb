      Proverbs 24:5-6 (NLT) – “The wise are mightier than the strong, and those
      with knowledge grow stronger and stronger. So don’t go to war without wise

      <b>What We Value:</b>
      <br>
      We believe in the importance of men living out life with other men. We become
      stronger, more faithful, and can stand in the gap for our families and community
      more effectively when devoted to Christ together.
    </p>
    <br>

    <p>
      Our Men’s Ministry is focused on spending intentional, focused time together in
      God’s Word. We openly discuss the Word as we read it, applying it to real life
      situations and examples from those in our midst.
